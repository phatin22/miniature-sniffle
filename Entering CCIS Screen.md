Place Vector on his charger and quickly press Vectors back button quickly which should show his `Pairing mode` which looks like this below.

Next, lift his arm up and down fully and it should show his `CCIS Menu` (Customer Care Information Screens) which is a group of screens that help Vector owners to identify issues with Vector's hardware or software in a relatively easy, intuitive way.

It should look something like this.

Let's go over the information on this screen, in this example I'm running WireOS but I'd imagine it would look similar on different OS'

**ESN**:  Your robots unique Serial Number
**OS**:  Current Operating System 
**VER**: Not visible on Vectors stock OS but, Current Version of Custom OS
**SSID**: Wifi Network Name
**IP**: The IP Address given to vector from your router, will be important later.
**EXIT**: Exit the CCIS menu back to normal
**SELF TEST**: Not used.
**Clear OUT SOUL**: Resets Vector back to Factory Settings. (Typically "CLEAR USER DATA" on stock OS)
